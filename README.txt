## ------Text Comparison App------
##   This app is designed to collect data from surveys where the participant is 
## shown a set of texts and is asked a question about those texts.  The provided 
## example datasets show the participant 20 sets of IMDB movie reviews and 
## ask the participant to select the most positive review.  Data collected from
## this app could be used with sentiment analysis alogrithms to determine the 
## degree of positivity expressed by English emotion words.  I codeveloped this
## app as my final project for my graduate level Political Science course,
## Applied Statistical Programming.
